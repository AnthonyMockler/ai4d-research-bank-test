      2022-05-31-patched-openaq.csv :
      Table patched from the sub-regression model experiment.
      Missing MAIAC AOD values were predicted using a model trained using CAM AOD data. 
      These predictions were appended to the existing AOD data used for training the AOD model. 
      This patched table was then used to predict PM 2.5 values
